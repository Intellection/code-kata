Task

Your task is to add up letters to one letter.

The function will be given a list of letters, each one being a letter to add.

Notes:
Letters will always be lowercase.
Letters can overflow (see second to last example of the description)
If no letters are given, the function should return 'z'

Examples:

(["a", "b", "c"]) => "f"
(["a", "b"]) => "c"
(["z"]) => "z"
(["z", "a"]) => "a"
(["y", "c", "b"]) => "d" # notice the letters overflowing
([]) => "z"
