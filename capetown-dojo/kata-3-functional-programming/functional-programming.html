# Functional Programming
## Herman Langner

---

# Overview
- Functional programming is a programming style not a language type
- Functional languages just strictly adhere to the principles of functional programming

---
# What is Functional programming

```
It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions 
or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function 
depends only on its arguments, so calling a function with the same value for an 
argument always produces the same result. This is in contrast to imperative programming 
where, in addition to a function's arguments, global program state can affect a function's 
resulting value

### aims
- more predictable code
- easier to understand
- more testable

---
# Functional Programming classifications
1. Pure functions
2. First-class functions
3. Higher-order functions
4. Referential transparency
5. Closures

---
# Pure functions
- given input x then the output will *always* be y
```ruby
#impure functions
  base_number = 0
  def increment_number(x)
    base_number + x #This is impure because base_number can be changed
                    # based on the state of the object so
                    # depending on the state of the object x will return different values
  end
#pure functions
  def increment_number(base_number, x)
    base_number + x #pure because the output will always be the same for the same input
  end
```
---
# Pure functions
- evaluation/execution has no side effects (static variables unchanged, mutable references unchanged)
```ruby
#impure functions
  base_number = 0
  def increment_number(x)
    base_number++
    base_number + x
  end
#pure functions
  def increment_number(base_number, x)
    base_number + x
  end
```
---
# First-class functions
First-class functions is how a language supports functions as first class citizens.
this is measured by:
- Higher-order functions (next slide) passing functions as arguments
- Anonymous and nested functions e.g. blocks in ruby
- Non-local variables and closures
---
# Higher order functions
A higher order function is a function that does at least one of
- takes one or more functions as an argument
- returns a function as a result

`map` is a common example, it takes a collection and function as input
and returns a collection with the function applied

```ruby
def gen_times(factor)
  return Proc.new {|n| n*factor }
end
```
---
# Referential transparency
just a honorable mention
```c
int globalValue = 0;

int rq(int x) {
  globalValue++;
  return x + globalValue;
}

int rt(int x) {
  return x + 1;
}
```
---
# Closures
A closure refers to the value of something (like a variable or a function) in an outer scope 
being available in the context of the inner scope, even if that inner scope is invoked much later
```javascript
let name = "Invader Zim"

let printName = () => console.log(name);

printName();

name = "Invader Skoodge"

printName();
```
```elixir
defmodule Example do
  def create_some_function() do
    number = 3

    fn -> IO.puts(number) end
  end
end

some_function = Example.create_some_function()

some_function.()
```

# Extras

# Composition over inheritance
Inheritance is when you design your types after what they are, 
while composition is when you design your types after what they can do

- Gorilla/banana problem, unused methods of base class
```ruby
dog            = pooper + barker
cat            = pooper + meower
cleaningRobot  = driver + cleaner
murderRobot    = driver + killer
murderRobotDog = driver + killer + barker
```

---
# Composition over inheritance

```ruby
const barker = (state) => ({
  bark: () => console.log('Woof, I am ' + state.name)
})
const driver = (state) => ({
  drive: () => state.position = state.position + state.speed
})

const murderRobotDog = (name)  => {
  let state = {
    name,
    speed: 100,
    position: 0
  }
  return Object.assign(
        {},
        barker(state),
        driver(state),
        killer(state)
    )
}
const bruno =  murderRobotDog('bruno')
bruno.bark() // "Woof, I am Bruno"
```

# Idempotency and scaling

- the nature of functional programming enforces idempotency
- when dealing with multiple apps and fault tolerance, idempotency simplifies a lot
---
# Function composition

- properly using composition leads to pretty dry code
```javascript
const sum = arr => arr.reduce((i, runningSum) => i + runningSum);
const average = (sum, count) => sum / count;
const averageArr = arr => average(sum(arr), arr.length);
```
